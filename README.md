## Getting Started

To run the game locally, you have two options:

**1. Simple File Opening:**

Since this is a front-end only project, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

**2. Using a Local Server (Recommended):**

For a better experience and to avoid any potential issues with browser security policies (especially regarding API requests), it's recommended to run the game on a local server.

If you have Python installed, you can run a simple HTTP server from the project's root directory:

```bash
# For Python 3
python -m http.server
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**
*   **[Anime.js](https://animejs.com/):** A lightweight JavaScript animation library.
